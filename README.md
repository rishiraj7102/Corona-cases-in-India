# Corona-cases-in-India
This is a basic Webapp created using PywebIO along with Python and Pandas
It fetches the data of all the cases and states in the json format from the Government of India website. Then by using Pandas and Python, I created functions to get specific cases on entering the state and the particular cases you want to see.
Then by PyWebIo, we create a web app to showcase the work.
